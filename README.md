## Bottleneck Solver: AI-Powered Workflow Planning**


An AI-driven tool that helps plant managers optimize production flows by detecting bottlenecks, recommending improvements, and forecasting the impact of workflow changes.

Key Features:
Real-Time Bottleneck Detection – AI identifies slowdowns and offers solutions, such as predictive maintenance or workflow adjustments.

Intelligent Scheduling Suggestions – Warns about tight timelines and proposes additional steps, like acceptance testing.

Scenario Simulation – Allows managers to test different strategies before implementing them in actual production.

Interactive Gantt-Style Chart – Visualizes production phases with AI-driven recommendations.

Example Bottleneck Case:
A soldering machine is operating slower than expected, causing delays in the production line. AI detects the slowdown, suggests preventive maintenance, and recommends redistributing work to avoid inefficiencies.
